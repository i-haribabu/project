    <h2>Data Science Intern (Brain O Vision Solutions Pvt. Ltd, Hyderabad, Off-Site) </h2><p>(From September 2023 - November 2023)</p>
    <h4>During my time at Brain O Vision Solutions, I made substantial contributions as a Data Science Intern.<br>
        My work with Python-based predictive models resulted in an outstanding 85% accuracy. <br>
        I also ensured high-quality input data through meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing, <br>
        significantly reducing error rates. Furthermore, I visualized data insights using Matplotlib <br>
        and Seaborn, creating comprehensive reports and dashboards</h4> <br>
    <h2>Machine Learning Intern (RINL, Visakhapatnam)</h2><p>(From March 2024 - April 2024)</p> 
    <h4>At RINL (Visakhapatnam Steel Plant), I delved into the intricacies of Machine Learning <br>
        to analyze and forecast material properties with remarkable precision. My efforts led <br>
        to a successful completion of a Machine Learning project based on Python, achieving an <br>
        impressive model accuracy of 95% in classifying data. By leveraging Random Forest <br>
        techniques, I accurately predicted tensile properties such as strain and strength based <br>
        on material composition, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of just 2% for <br>
        tensile strength predictions.</h4> <br>
    <h2>Python Full Stack Intern (Excelr, Bengaluru, Off-Site)</h2><p>(From June 2024 - July 2024)</p> 
    <h4>During my internship with Excelr, I took on the challenge of developing end-to-end <br>
        web applications using Python.I also designed and implemented responsive front-end <br>
        interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which improved user experience by 30%.
