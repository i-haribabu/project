    I completed my 10th grade in 2019 at A.P. Model School under the Andhra Pradesh 
    State Board, achieving an impressive GPA of "9.5". 
                           
    Subsequently, I pursued my intermediate education at Sri Chaitanya Junior College 
    in Visakhapatnam, where I secured "950" marks in 2021.
        
    Currently, I am in my final year of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at 
    Miracle Educational Society Group of Institutions in Miracle City, Bhogapuram, 
    maintaining a CGPA of "8.40". 
                            
    My academic journey reflects my dedication and consistent performance, and I am 
    eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting.

    In addition to my academic journey, I have completed several internships that
    have provided me with hands-on experience in the field of computer science.

    I am eager to leverage my academic background, practical experience, and passion 
    for technology in a professional environment.

    I am confident that my dedication, problem-solving skills, and ability to adapt 
    to new challenges will enable me to contribute meaningfully to any organization 
    I join.
