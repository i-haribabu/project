    <h4>
    Predicting tensile properties of materials, such as tensile strength and yield strength,is crucial in materials engineering.<br>
    Traditional methods involve destructive testing using Universal Testing Machines (UTMs), which are costly and  <br>
    time-consuming.Machine learning offers a non-destructive alternative by leveraging data on material composition <br>
    and processing parameters to predict these properties accurately.

    <h4>
    Used Various machine learning techniques, including linear regression, support vector machines (SVM),<br>
    random forests, and artificial neural networks (ANNs), are employed to predict tensile properties.<br>
    These models are trained on datasets containing information about material composition,<br>
    heat treatment, and mechanical properties. The models learn patterns and relationships within the data. <br> <br>
    
    </h4>
    <h4>
    Predicting tensile properties using machine learning has significant applications in industries such as automotive,  <br> 
    aerospace, and construction. It allows for the optimization of material selection and processing parameters, <br>
    leading to improved product performance and reduced development costs. Additionally, it minimizes the need for <br>
    extensive physical testing, saving both time and resources. <br><br>
    </h4>
    <h4>
    While machine learning models have shown promising results, challenges remain, such as ensuring model accuracy <br>
    and generalizability across different materials and conditions. Future research aims to enhance model robustness<br>
    by incorporating more comprehensive datasets and advanced algorithms. Continued advancements in this field <br>
    will further streamline.<br> <br>
