    <h4>
    Predicting tensile properties of materials, such as tensile strength <br>
    and yield strength,is crucial in materials engineering. Traditional <br>
    methods involve destructive testing using Universal Testing Machines (UTMs), <br>
    which are costly and time-consuming. Machine learning offers a <br>
    non-destructive alternative by leveraging data on material composition and <br>
    processing parameters to predict these properties accurately.

    <h4>
    Used Various machine learning techniques, including linear regression, <br>
    support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and artificial neural <br>
    networks (ANNs), are employed to predict tensile properties. These<br> 
    models are trained on datasets containing information about material <br>
    composition, heat treatment, and mechanical properties. The models learn <br>
    patterns and relationships within the data. 
    </h4>
    <h4>
    Predicting tensile properties using machine learning has significant <br>
    applications in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and construction.<br> 
    It allows for the optimization of material selection and processing <br>
    parameters, leading to improved product performance and reduced development <br>
    costs. Additionally, it minimizes the need for extensive physical testing, <br>
    saving both time and resources.
    </h4>
    <h4>
    While machine learning models have shown promising results, challenges <br>
    remain, such as ensuring model accuracy and generalizability across <br>
    different materials and conditions. Future research aims to enhance model <br>
    robustness by incorporating more comprehensive datasets and advanced <br>
    algorithms. Continued advancements in this field will further streamline.
